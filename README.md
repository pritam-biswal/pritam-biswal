# 👋 Hi, I’m a Flutter Developer  

I’m a **learner developer** who enjoys turning ideas into real apps. I believe the best way to grow is by building, so I spend most of my time experimenting with Flutter, trying out new tools, and learning something new every day.  

Currently, I’m focusing on **frontend development with Flutter**, and in the future, I aim to dive deeper into **databases, Firebase, APIs, and backend development** to become a full-stack mobile developer.

## 🔥 What I’m Working On  
- Writing clean and maintainable Flutter & Dart code  
- Exploring UI/UX for better mobile experiences  
- Building projects regularly to sharpen my skills  
- Learning step by step: **Frontend → Database → Firebase → APIs → Backend**  
- Staying curious and open to new technologies

✨ For me, coding is more than just problem-solving — it’s about **creating things that feel good to use, make sense, and help me grow as a developer**.

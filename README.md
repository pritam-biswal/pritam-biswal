# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a Flutter Developer  

Iâ€™m a **learner developer** who enjoys turning ideas into real apps. I believe the best way to grow is by building, so I spend most of my time experimenting with Flutter, trying out new tools, and learning something new every day.  

Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on **frontend development with Flutter**, and in the future, I aim to dive deeper into **databases, Firebase, APIs, and backend development** to become a full-stack mobile developer.

## ðŸ”¥ What Iâ€™m Working On  
- Writing clean and maintainable Flutter & Dart code  
- Exploring UI/UX for better mobile experiences  
- Building projects regularly to sharpen my skills  
- Learning step by step: **Frontend â†’ Database â†’ Firebase â†’ APIs â†’ Backend**  
- Staying curious and open to new technologies  



âœ¨ For me, coding is more than just problem-solving â€” itâ€™s about **creating things that feel good to use, make sense, and help me grow as a developer**.
